# Goal

Focusing on practical, easy-to-understand resources that require minimal investment, develop a toolkit that can significantly improve the cybersecurity posture of small and medium-sized businesses. The emphasis should be on making complex concepts accessible and actionable for non-experts.


Here's a list of key resources and materials our group could develop for such a toolkit:

1. **Risk Assessment Process Guide:** A step-by-step guide outlining the risk assessment process, drawing from the methodologies described in "How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity". This guide would include methods to identify, quantify, and prioritize risks.
2. **Risk Measurement Templates:** Develop templates for measuring and quantifying risks, as suggested in the book. These could include templates for data collection, risk analysis models, and methods for estimating the probability and impact of different cybersecurity threats.
3. **Risk Appetite Framework:** Provide a comprehensive resource on understanding and determining a company's risk appetite. This would include guidelines on how to align risk-taking levels with business objectives and risk tolerance.
4. **Training Modules on Risk Assessment Techniques:** Create interactive modules or webinars that teach the basics of risk assessment, particularly focusing on the quantitative approaches advocated in the book. These modules would be valuable for new GRC practitioners or small businesses undertaking GRC tasks independently.
5. **Case Studies and Examples:** Compile a collection of case studies that illustrate the practical application of risk assessment techniques in different scenarios. These real-world examples can help businesses understand the nuances of risk assessment in a practical context.
6. **Checklists for Common Cybersecurity Risks:** Develop checklists that cover common cybersecurity risks faced by small and medium businesses. These checklists would help businesses quickly assess their vulnerability to these common threats.
7. **Risk Assessment Workshop Materials:** Create materials for workshops that guide businesses through the process of conducting a risk assessment. This could include presentation slides, facilitator guides, and participant worksheets.
8. **Risk Assessment Software Tool Recommendations:** Provide a curated list of software tools that can aid in risk assessment. This list should focus on cost-effective or free tools suitable for businesses with limited budgets.
9. **Links and recommendations for community forums** where businesses can ask questions and share experiences related to risk assessment.
10. **Links, recommendations, and digest (executive summary) versions of Threat Intelligence Reports:** Offer resources that keep businesses informed about the latest cybersecurity threats and trends.
11. **Prompts, guides, and links to AI's that specialize in Risk Assessment.** Building and improving a GPT specifically to help SMBs with customizing the risk assessment runbooks and plans here in our project is one project that is already underway.

Some of these are harder to develop and produce than others. Some will easier for folks that have done them before. If you see something that would be of interest to you, please feel free to jump in contribute your efforts!
You can coordinate with any of the collaborators you see active in the repo, and thank you for your valuable contributions!
